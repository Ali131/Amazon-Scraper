Amazon Multi Account Order History Scraper :~

This tool was made by the special request of a client. It actually uses list of accounts then login
one by one account and scrap its all order history from starting to the current date. Then save this
data into a csv file in a well manner formate. This script includes bypass of different types of account
login verification e.g. phone number, city , state type of verifications etc.

Its really fast and effective tool. This tool was my first big approach in python programing.

How to use?

Just run the script and follow the instructions. Make sure accounts.txt file placed into the same directory
where script is placed including information like this:
